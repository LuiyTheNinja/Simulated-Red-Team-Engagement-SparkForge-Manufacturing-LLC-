# Simulated-Red-Team-Engagement-SparkForge-Manufacturing-LLC-
Engagement Period: [17OCT2025] - [TBD] Red Team Lead: LuiyTheNinja1993

Executive Summary
This project outlines a simulated red team engagement against SparkForge Manufacturing, LLC, a fictional small-to-medium enterprise (SME) specializing in precision industrial component manufacturing. The objective of this engagement is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of red teaming methodologies, from initial reconnaissance and intelligence gathering (OSINT), through physical and technical infiltration, to post-exploitation tactics.

SparkForge Manufacturing has been selected as the target due to its plausible blend of modern office infrastructure, legacy industrial control systems (ICS/OT), and a typical employee demographic, presenting a realistic challenge for threat emulation. This report details the preparation, planning, and execution phases, culminating in a series of actionable findings designed to enhance the security posture of similar organizations.
